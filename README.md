# EllipticOrbitCalculator

Displays a list of parameters describing an elliptic orbit. When user inputs all the parameters
they're given, the program outputs any more parameters that can be derived from these.


TODO:
-Add degrees-to-radians converter for ease of use

-There are a huge number of formulas used- perhaps unnecessarily. I need to model the system
using some kind of decision logic to find out exactly how many formulae are required. 

-Add the vector forms of v, r, e, etc.
